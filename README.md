### **Milestone project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

A personal webpage displaying personal skills and experience to attract recruiters as well as those looking to collaborate. 
The weboage provides a summary of skills, work history and education with an option to download a copy of a pdf CV for more information. 
There is also an area where any questions can be submitted.

## UX
To make the website stand out as a potential candidate a clear and easily read one page layout was chosen which flows through the information needed and looks nice.

### User Stories
* As a recruiter, I want to view a person's skills, so that I can decide whether they have the correct skills for an open role.
* As a recruiter, I want to view a person's education history, so that I can ensure they have the correct credentials for an open role.
* As a recruiter, I want to view a person's work experience history, so that I can ensure they have the correct experience for an open role.
* As a recruiter, I want to obtain a CV, so that I can share this with companies or individuals.
* As a recruiter, I want to ask a question, so that I can find out more details or invite someone to an interview.
* As a recruiter, I want to view a person's portfolio, so that I can see their quality of work.


### Strategy
It was decided that the site would be aimed at recruiters and individuals or companies looking to collaborate with a developer by supplying them with all the information they need to promote myself as a developer.

### Scope
The main features thought to be the most important were; an about me section to give some background information, a resume section to outline skills and education/experience, finally with a ocntact page to make it easy to contact me.

### Structure
Each section should give enough information for a recruiter to learn enough about the candidate to make a decision on whether they want to find out more, there is then an option to download a pdf version of a CV so that the webpage is not crammed full of information which will most probably not be as eye catching.

### Skeleton
Figma was used to design a wireframe, you can view it below or <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/RdOmB4ks8GmqkZWuD6E7LU/Milestone-1-wireframe?node-id=212512%3A0" target="_blank">here</a>

### Surface
The font and colours were decided on because they need to stand out, but also look nice, so by using black text on a pale background this makes the weboage easy to read. It was also decided that the background would be fixed so that as you scroll you have a constant circular background.

## Features
* Single page design - linear navigation flow to make the experience more continuous and fluid. With a minimal web design the user's focus is on the most important content.
* Sticky/Fixed Navbar - gives user a sense of control and allows them to use the links to jump to any section on the site at any time.
* Collapsing Navbar - Navbar will collapse and replaced by a hamburger menu on smaller screens (below 768px) for a cleaner look.
* Fixed background - an innovative idea that allows for smooth transitions between sections 
* Bootstrap Grid system - each section uses the Bootstrap grid system so that it is responsive for when being viewed on a smaller screen.
* Progress Bars - as seen in a module the progress bars are a great visual way to display skills without using a lot of words.
* Work Experience Timeline - also as seen in a module the timeline view is a good way to present a timeline of jobs I have had.
* Download CV Link - for any recruiters that wish to view a pdf version of my CV there is a link in the footer which will open it in a new tab.

### **Features to be implemented in the future**
* Modal Box for CV download - to give the recruiter an option to either download the CV as a pdf or have it sent to an email address.
* Add a location for Contact Me form - when the Contact Me form is filled out the information will be sent to an email address so that a reply can be sent.

## Technologies
1. HTML5 - to create content for website
2. CSS3 - to style HTML content to look nice
3. <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/RdOmB4ks8GmqkZWuD6E7LU/Milestone-1-wireframe?node-id=212512%3A0" target="_blank">Figma</a> - to create wireframes
4. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> - as a responsive template to personalise with own CSS

## Testing
As it is key that the website is responsive so that it can be viewed on all kinds of devices and programs 
I have tested the webpage on 2 different mobile devices (iPhone XS & OnePlus) also on a large desktop as well as a smaller Macbook desktop screen. 
I have also trialed the site on Chrome and Safari to ensure it works fine on both.

Contact Form:
* Tried to submit form with no info to ensure the required pop up appears
* Tried submitting form with an invalid email address to ensure the valid email address pop up appears
* Tried to submit form with all valid inputs to ensure no pop ups appears

Download CV:
* Tested `Download CV` link to ensure pdf version of CV opened in new tab

Social Media Links:
* Tested all links to ensure the correct social media account opened in a new tab

## Deployment
This site is hosted on GitHub using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The site will update automatically after any new commits from the master branch. 
So that the site deploys correctly the landing page has been named `index.html`.
